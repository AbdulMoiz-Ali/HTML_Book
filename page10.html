    <h1>< strong></h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The use of the < strong> element indicates that its content has strong
        importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be
        said with strong emphasis.
      </li>
      <li>
        By default, browsers will show the contents of a < strong> element in
        bold.

                emphasis that subtly changes
                the meaning of a sentence.

        <li>By default browsers will show
            the contents of an <em> element
