    <h1>< cite></h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or
        research paper, the < cite> element can be used to indicate where the
        citation is from.
      </li>
      <li>
        In HTML5, < cite> should not really be used for a person's name â€” but it
        was allowed in HTML 4, so most people are likely to continue to use it.
      </li>
      <li>Browsers will render the content of a < cite> element in italics.</li>

    <h1>< dfn></h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first time you explain some new terminology (perhaps an academic
        concept or some jargon) in a document, it is known as the defining
        instance of it.
      </li>
      <li>
        The < dfn> element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new
        term.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some browsers show the content of the < dfn> element in italics. Safari
        and Chrome do not change its appearance.
