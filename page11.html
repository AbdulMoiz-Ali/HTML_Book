    <h1>< blockquote></h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The < blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up an
        entire paragraph. Note how the < p> element is still used inside the <
        blockquote> element.
      </li>
      <li>
        Browsers tend to indent the contents of the < blockquote> element,
        however you should not use this element just to indent a piece of text —
        rather you should achieve this effect using CSS.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h1>< q></h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The < q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph.
        Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the < q> element, however
        Internet Explorer does not — therefore many people avoid using the < q>
        element.
      </li>
      <li>
        Both elements may use the cite attribute to indicate where the quote is
        from. Its value should be a URL that will have more information about
        the source of the quotation.
      </li>
    </ul>
