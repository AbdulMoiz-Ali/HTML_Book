        As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new
        paragraph or heading on a new line. <br />
        But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph
        you can use the line break tag < br />.

    <h1>< hr /></h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book
        or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between
        sections using the < hr /> tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening
        and closing tag. They are known as empty elements and they are written
        differently.
      </li>
      <li>
        An empty element usually has only one tag. Before the closing angled
        bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward
        slash character. Some web page authors miss this out but it is a good
        habit to get into.
