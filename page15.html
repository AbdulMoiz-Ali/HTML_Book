    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The < ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted
        into a document, while the < del> element can show text that has been
        deleted from it.
      </li>
      <li>
        The content of a < ins> element is usually underlined, while the content
        of a < del> element usually has a line through it.

    <h1>< s></h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The < s> element indicates something that is no longer accurate or
        relevant (but that should not be deleted).
      </li>
      <li>
        Visually the content of an < s> element will usually be displayed with a
        line through the center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Older versions of HTML had a < u> element for content that was
        underlined, but this is being phased out.
